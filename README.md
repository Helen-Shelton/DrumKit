# DrumKit

Further exploration of Javascript:

Built a website that mimicks the sound of drums using MP3 audio, at the mouse click or keyboard press of a user. Button animation upon click or press.


Concepts used/explored:

Switch and Case: Used to choose appropriate sound corresponding to specific drum image.

Event listeners: "keydown" (key presses) & "click" (mouse clicks). Used for detecting user input

Objects: Constructors, Properties, Methods and "this" keyword. Used in creating the switch-case sound function (keyboardSound()) and button animation function    (buttonAnimation())

Functions: Anonymous, Higher-order and Callback functions. Used in implementation of event listeners.
